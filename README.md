# keyboard-first

Keyboard-driven workflow for macOS: many terminals / Claude Code instances, Slack,
Chrome, IntelliJ — minimal mouse. Full spec and runbook: [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md).

## Architecture (HANDOFF §2)

| Layer | Scope | Tool |
|-------|-------|------|
| In-window | Many workflows in **one** terminal window | tmux (+ tmuxinator) |
| Windows | Switch / tile / focus app windows | AeroSpace |
| In-app | Act inside the focused app | App shortcuts, IdeaVim |

Input surface: ZSA Moonlander layers + a **Hyper** key (⌃⌥⇧⌘), Raycast as
launcher/fallback. Hyper is emitted by **Moonlander firmware only** (Oryx thumb
key) — the built-in keyboard has no Hyper by design (accepted trade-off; fallback
is Raycast / ⌘Tab / `aerospace` CLI, contingency in `karabiner/`).

## Quickstart

```bash
./scripts/install.sh   # idempotent: brew installs + symlinks; prints manual steps
```

## Status

| Phase | What | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| 0 | Repo scaffold, install script | ✅ done (2026-06-04) |
| 1 | AeroSpace (window layer) | ✅ done (2026-06-04) — §5.4 criteria pass; Hyper chords owner-confirmed; workspace assignments live. IntelliJ dialog float rules: add when one annoys (wait-and-see) |
| 2 | tmux (in-window layer) | ✅ done (2026-06-04) — §4.4 criteria pass: config + plugins load, `deploy` (3 named panes) and `cc` (2 live CC instances, TUI renders correctly) reproduce detached, sessions independent of clients |
| 3 | In-app layer (Slack / IntelliJ / Chrome) | ✅ done (2026-06-04) — ideavimrc committed + linked; cheatsheets for Slack/IntelliJ/Chrome; 8.5 resolved (Vimium C). Two manual installs pending: IdeaVim plugin, Vimium C extension (install.sh steps 5–6) |
| 4 | Enthium learning (parallel track) | ⬜ start drills anytime |
| 5 | Glue + refinement (Moonlander layers, Raycast) | ⬜ |

Hard sequencing rule: **environment first on QWERTY; Enthium switch last.**

## Decision log (HANDOFF §8)

| # | Decision | Resolution | Date |
|---|----------|------------|------|
| 8.1 | Terminal emulator | **iTerm2 + tmux** (lowest friction) | 2026-06-04 |
| 8.2 | tmux prefix | **Ctrl-Space** (Moonlander key can emit it later) | 2026-06-04 |
| 8.6 | AeroSpace mod | **Hyper** (⌃⌥⇧⌘), emitted by **Moonlander firmware only** (owner is almost always on it) — no Karabiner, no system extension. Built-in keyboard fallback: Raycast / ⌘Tab / `aerospace` CLI; `karabiner/hyper.json` kept as opt-in contingency. Hyper contains Shift, so window-move is a `move` mode (Hyper-m), not mod-shift chords. | 2026-06-04 |
| 8.7 | Dotfiles manager | **Plain symlink script** (`scripts/install.sh`) | 2026-06-04 |
| 8.3 | Workspace scheme | 1 terminal, 2 work chrome, 4 intellij, 5 utilities (floating) → **Dell**; 3 comms/media (slack + obsidian + spotify), 7 personal chrome → **Retina** (hyper-3/7 picks which shows); 6 tracking chrome → **LG**. Pins use fallback `['x','main']` for undocked. Monitor keys: Hyper-period throws focused *window* to next monitor (pinned workspaces can't move — force-assignment is hard), Hyper-semicolon jumps focus. | 2026-06-04 |
| 8.8 | tmux persistence | resurrect + continuum **on** — *starting point, iterate* | 2026-06-04 |
| 8.5 | Chrome in-page nav | **Vimium C**, in work + personal profiles (Vimari is Safari-only, so the real choice was Vimium/Vimium C vs none; link hints were the last mouse dependency). Settings export → `chrome/` once customized. | 2026-06-04 |
| 8.4 | Home-row mods | **Open** — deferred until Enthium base is fluent (Phase 4/5) |  |

Repo filenames are unhidden (`tmux/tmux.conf`, not `.tmux.conf`); `install.sh`
maps them to their dotfile locations.

## Chrome: three instances, three monitors

All Chrome windows share one bundle ID, so routing is title-based (see
`aerospace.toml` comments for the verified title formats):

- **Tracking** window is a Chrome *named window* (`second chrome` — set via
  right-click tab strip → "Name window…"; survives Chrome restarts) → ws 6 (LG).
- **Personal** profile is matched by end-anchor `Guillermo$` (work titles
  continue with `(decisionbrain.com)`) → ws 7 (Retina).
- Everything else (work profile, incognito) → ws 2 (Dell).

If the tracking window is ever recreated from scratch: re-name it `second
chrome`, then `Hyper-m → 6` once. Don't rename the personal profile in a way
that adds text after the name, or the end-anchor breaks.

## Operational notes

- **AeroSpace is pre-1.0**: read release notes before `brew upgrade`.
  Installed: **0.20.3-Beta** (2026-06-04)
- Raycast is installed outside Homebrew (self-updates); install.sh detects and
  skips it.
- Oryx and Raycast hold state in GUIs — record choices in `keyboard/KEYMAP.md` and
  `raycast/notes.md` as they're made.
